# Predicting Car Categories and Purchase Prices: A Machine Learning Approach to Consumer Behavior Analysis
## Project Overview
### Part I. Applying Statiscal Concepts
#### 1. Car Category Prediction Using Machine Learning: Leveraging Demographic and Purchase Data for Classification
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify which category of car (e.g., SUV, sedan) a customer is likely to purchase, based on demographic factors such as age, income, gender, and historical purchase data. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that assists in understanding consumer preferences in car categories.

#### 2. Predicting Vehicle Purchase Price with Regression Models: Analyzing Customer Spending Behavior Based on Income, Gender, and Region
This project aims to develop regression models to predict how much a customer is likely to spend on a vehicle. It analyzes key features such as income, gender, region, and other socio-economic variables to model the purchasing power and spending patterns of car buyers.
