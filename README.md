# Predicting Car Categories and Purchase Prices: A Machine Learning Approach to Consumer Behavior Analysis
## Project Overview

In 2023, there were 1.76 million cars sold in Canada which translates to around a 12.9% increase year over year. Understanding customer preferences and spending behavior is key to staying competitive in this industry. This project uses a clustering model to classify potential buyers into different car categories (SUV, Hatchback, etc.) by leveraging demographic data such as age, income, and gender. It also employs a regression model to forecast how much a customer might spend on a vehicle based on factors like income, region, and gender. Together, these provide valuable insights that will help businesses fine-tune their marketing and pricing strategies, ensuring they meet customer needs while maximizing profitability.

The questions this project aims to address are:

### 1. Which car category (e.g., SUV vs sedan) a customer is likely to purchase based on demographic factors and historical purchase data?

### 2. How much is a customer likely to spend on a vehicle based on features such as income, gender and region?
