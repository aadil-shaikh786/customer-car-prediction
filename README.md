# Predicting Car Categories and Purchase Prices: A Machine Learning Approach to Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

### Part I. Applying Statiscal Concepts

#### 1. Car Category Prediction Using Machine Learning: Leveraging Demographic and Purchase Data for Classification

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify which category of car (e.g., SUV, sedan) a customer is likely to purchase, based on demographic factors such as age, income, gender, and historical purchase data. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that assists in understanding consumer preferences in car categories.

#### 2. Predicting Vehicle Purchase Price with Regression Models: Analyzing Customer Spending Behavior Based on Income, Gender, and Region

This project aims to develop regression models to predict how much a customer is likely to spend on a vehicle. It analyzes key features such as income, gender, region, and other socio-economic variables to model the purchasing power and spending patterns of car buyers.

## Introduction

## Data Collection

The dataset for this project is from Kaggle: [Car Sales Report Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report). It captures key aspects of automotive sales transactions, simulating various dimensions of car sales, including customer demographics, dealer information, and specific details about the vehicles. Below, we provide a detailed breakdown of the collected data and its relevance to our research objectives.

Attributes of the Dataset
The dataset contains the following key columns, each representing important information related to car sales:

Car_id (String): Unique identifier for each car in the dataset.
Date (Datetime): The date of the transaction (format: MM/DD/YYYY).
Customer Name (String): Name of the customer who purchased the vehicle.
Gender (String): Gender of the customer (e.g., Male).
Annual Income (Integer): Annual income of the customer (in local currency).
Dealer_Name (String): Name of the car dealership where the sale was made.
Company (String): Manufacturer or company of the car (e.g., Ford, Cadillac).
Model (String): The specific model of the car sold (e.g., Expedition, Eldorado).
Engine (String): Type of engine (e.g., Overhead Camshaft, Double Overhead Camshaft).
Transmission (String): Type of transmission (e.g., Auto, Manual).
Color (String): The color of the vehicle sold (e.g., Black, Red).
Price ($) (Integer): Price of the car in dollars.
Dealer_No (String): Unique identifier for the dealership.
Body Style (String): The body style of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, Hatchback, Passenger).
Phone (String): Phone number associated with the dealership.
Dealer_Region (String): Geographical region of the dealership (e.g., Middletown, Aurora).
